to onboard new members for a new year:
 - make a new members repository with new year as folder name under about/members/new_year
 - update the archives list for each html page
 - make a copy of the most recent (new_year/index.html) in the about/members repository (instead of a level deeper), since the "members" link on the main page points to this index.html
 - make sure the img repository for this copy has the updated photos
 - create author profiles for each new writer

I took a film class at my junior high school, attended the Multimedia Arts and Design Academy for my 9th-11th grade years, and applied and was accepted to Interlochen Arts Academy for the Motion Picture Arts major for my senior year. I am so excited to see what change I can make by sparking creativity, entertainment, and love into the world!</p>

At Brown, he is an actor for Production Workshop, a nationally competitive slam poet, and of course, a cinephile. His love for film started as early as second grade, when he watched <em>Slumdog Millionaire</em>. He was mesmerized by how the film was able to combine a whimsical tale with an expos&eacute; of such somber issues. Some of his favorite films of the past decade include <em>Boyhood</em>, <em>Call Me by Your Name</em>, and <em>Shoplifters</em>. His fascination with film criticism stems from the intersection of two of his artistic passions: writing and cinema.</p>

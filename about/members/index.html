          <p class="description">Michael Culbertson graduated from University of North Carolina (UNC) Greensboro with a Bachelor&rsquo;s in Psychology, and is currently attending UNC School of the Arts for his Master&rsquo;s in Screenwriting. While the degrees seem to be unrelated, he feels his psychology background helps him better understand the characters in his writing, as well as elements that an audience member may find captivating and emotional. He believes film criticism is essential for helping aspiring and prominent filmmakers improve their craft, and takes inspiration for reviewing from viral YouTube reviewers Chris Stuckman and Jeremy Jahns. His current favorite films are <em>The Incredibles</em>, <em>Get Out</em>, and <em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em>.</p>

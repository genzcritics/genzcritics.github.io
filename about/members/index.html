Michael recently moved to Los Angeles to get a jump start on his career and hopes to make it into film or TV animation writing.

          <p class="description">From the age of four I started musical theatre, and did a bit of acting for fun until 5th grade, when I decided to write, shoot, and edit a musical movie (albeit it was not very good due to the fact that I was in 5th grade) but I fell in love with the filmmaking world. I took a film class at my junior high school, attended the Multimedia Arts and Design Academy for my 9th-11th grade years, and applied and was accepted to Interlochen Arts Academy for the Motion Picture Arts major for my senior year. I am so excited to see what change I can make by sparking creativity, entertainment, and love into the world!</p>

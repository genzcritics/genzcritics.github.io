It is ultimately Jacob&rsquo;s dream to one day write and direct his own feature film. Jacob believes writing about film is both difficult yet rewarding: writing about cinema is meditating, but on the other hand, film is a visual medium, so how many words can speak for the power of the screen? Some of Jacob&rsquo;s favorite films include: <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, <em>The Godfather</em>, <em>Taxi Driver</em>, <em>Eyes Wide Shut</em>, <em>Star Wars</em> (1977), <em>Pickpocket</em>, <em>Au Hasard Balthazar</em>, <em>Tampopo</em>, <em>Dazed and Confused</em>, <em>Spirited Away</em>, and <em>Slacker</em>&mdash;a healthy mix of mainstream, foreign, and independent cinema.</p>

          <p class="description">My name is Ryan Parker. I was born in New London, Connecticut, and was raised in Hingham, Massachusetts. I first gained interest in film after watching Alfonso Cuarón&rsquo;s <em>Children of Men</em> (2006) in a high school literature class. This led me to attending American University in Washington, D.C., where I study film production. At AU, I have broadened my library of film, ranging from Independent Genre Cinema to International Arthouse. Since attending college, I have written for several student-run film criticism publications, including <a href="https://lacemagx.com/reviews/" target="_blank">LACE Magazine</a> and <a href=https://medium.com/b-roll" target="_blank">B-Roll</a>, where I share my love and appreciation of film to a larger audience. Some of my favorite films include <em>The Witch</em> (2015), <em>Come and See</em> (1985), and <em>In the Mood for Love</em> (2000).</p>

            <p>At first&#44; I didn&rsquo;t like Lemony Snicket&rsquo;s <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em> (2004) &#91;1&#93;. Compared to the books&#44; the film resolved conflicts too quickly&#44; which diminished any feeling of tension. In retrospect&#44; I think I might&rsquo;ve been too harsh&#44; as director Brad Silberling faced the Herculean task of adapting three books into one feature-length film. The plot needed to flow seamlessly from one story to the next&#44; which couldn&rsquo;t have happened unless key parts of the books were trimmed down.</p>

            <p>Three children&mdash;Violet &#40;Emily Browning&#41;&#44; the oldest&#59; Klaus &#40;Liam Aiken&#41;&#44; the middle child&#59; and baby Sunny &#40;Kara and Shelby Hoffman&#41;&mdash;lose their parents in a fire that destroys their home. The Baudelaires are placed in the care of their closest living relative&#44; Count Olaf &#40;Jim Carrey&#41;&mdash;a sinister man solely interested in the fortune the Baudelaires&rsquo; parents left behind. Luckily&#44; Mr. Poe &#40;Timothy Spall&#41;&#44; a banker in charge of the orphans&rsquo; affairs&#44; witnesses the Count attempting to kill the children to inherit their money and reassigns the Baudelaires to new guardians&mdash;first to their reptile-loving Uncle Monty &#40;Billy Connolly&#41; and later to their phobiaphobic &#91;2&#93; Aunt Josephine &#40;Meryl Streep&#41;. In each case&#44; Olaf arrives in disguise&#44; murders the Baudelaires&rsquo; guardian&#44; and launches a devilish scheme to seize their inheritance. To make matters worse&#44; the Count eventually regains custody of the children by pretending to save their lives in front of Mr. Poe. &#91;3&#93; Anytime the Baudelaires turn to an adult for help&#44; they aren&rsquo;t taken seriously&#44; which forces the children to escape Olaf&rsquo;s trials on their own.</p>

            <p>Despite the seemingly high stakes&#44; it&rsquo;s difficult to be in suspense&#44; as the Baudelaires foil most of the Count&rsquo;s plans with ease. When Uncle Monty suspiciously dies shortly after Olaf&rsquo;s arrival&#44; it doesn&rsquo;t take much for the children to disprove the Count&rsquo;s claim to the authorities that it was the work of Monty&rsquo;s snake&#44; the Incredibly Deadly Viper. In the book&#44; Sunny creates a diversion to buy her siblings time to find the necessary evidence&#41;&mdash;with Klaus searching Monty&rsquo;s library and Violet picking the lock to Olaf&rsquo;s suitcase&#41;&mdash;whereas in the film&#44; Sunny merely lets the Viper play with her to prove that it&rsquo;s harmless. Compared to the book&#44; defeating Olaf seemed too easy.</p>

            <p>Looking back&#44; I couldn&rsquo;t have expected Silberling to retell each book in its entirety&#44; as a film with three climaxes would&rsquo;ve grown tiresome. As Silberling mentions in the commentary track&#44; he didn&rsquo;t want the plot to get repetitive&#44; so he moved the final chapters of <em>The Bad Beginning</em> to the end of the film to serve as the climax while abridging the endings to the other books to serve as minor conflicts along the way. Of the three books&#44; I feel that the ending to <em>The Bad Beginning</em> is the most effective as the height of the film. Having the children escape Olaf&#44; only to wind up back in his hands&#44; brings the narrative full circle. &#91;4&#93;</p>

            <p>While I prefer the current Netflix show Lemony Snicket&rsquo;s <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em>&#44; which better suits the episodic nature of the books&#44; Silberling&rsquo;s work shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked. Back in 2004&#44; adapting the series into a movie was the only option&#58; the <em>Harry Potter</em> film adaptations were massively successful&#44; both critically and financially&#44; and big budget shows such as <em>Game of Thrones</em> wouldn&rsquo;t come around until a few years later. A film wasn&rsquo;t the ideal medium for these stories&#44; which makes Silberling&rsquo;s accomplishment of weaving them into a coherent narrative all the more impressive.</p>

            <p>&#91;1&#93; The film is based off of the first three books in the series of the same name. The books covered include: <em>The Bad Beginning</em> &#40;which concerns the children with Count Olaf&#41;&#59; <em>The Reptile Room</em> &#40;the children with Uncle Monty&#41;&#59; and <em>The Wide Window</em> &#40;the children with Aunt Josephine&#41;.</p>
            <p>&#91;2&#93; Afraid of everything.</p>
            <p>&#91;3&#93; Olaf had endangered the children earlier, thus creating an opportunity for his own heroism.</p>
            <p>&#91;4&#93; I wonder if the series&rsquo; author David Handler (who goes by the pseudonym Lemony Snicket) was inspired by Silberling&rsquo;s decision, as the twelfth book, <em>The Penultimate Peril</em>, also ends with the children back in Olaf&rsquo;s clutches.</p>

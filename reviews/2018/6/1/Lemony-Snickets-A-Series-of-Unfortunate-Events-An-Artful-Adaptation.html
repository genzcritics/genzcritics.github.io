            <p>At first, I didn&rsquo;t like Lemony Snicket&rsquo;s <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em> (2004) &#91;1&#93;. Compared to the books, the film resolved conflicts too quickly, which diminished any feeling of tension. In retrospect, I think I might&rsquo;ve been too harsh, as director Brad Silberling faced the Herculean task of adapting three books into one feature-length film. The plot needed to flow seamlessly from one story to the next, which couldn&rsquo;t have happened unless key parts of the books were trimmed down.</p>

            <p>Three children&mdash;Violet (Emily Browning), the oldest; Klaus (Liam Aiken), the middle child; and baby Sunny (Kara and Shelby Hoffman)&mdash;lose their parents in a fire that destroys their home. The Baudelaires are placed in the care of their closest living relative, Count Olaf (Jim Carrey)&mdash;a sinister man solely interested in the fortune the Baudelaires&rsquo; parents left behind. Luckily, Mr. Poe (Timothy Spall), a banker in charge of the orphans&rsquo; affairs, witnesses the Count attempting to kill the children to inherit their money and reassigns the Baudelaires to new guardians&mdash;first to their reptile-loving Uncle Monty (Billy Connolly) and later to their phobiaphobic &#91;2&#93; Aunt Josephine (Meryl Streep). In each case, Olaf arrives in disguise, murders the Baudelaires&rsquo; guardian, and launches a devilish scheme to seize their inheritance. To make matters worse, the Count eventually regains custody of the children by pretending to save their lives in front of Mr. Poe. &#91;3&#93; Anytime the Baudelaires turn to an adult for help, they aren&rsquo;t taken seriously, which forces the children to escape Olaf&rsquo;s trials on their own.</p>

            <p>Despite the seemingly high stakes, it&rsquo;s difficult to be in suspense, as the Baudelaires foil most of the Count&rsquo;s plans with ease. When Uncle Monty suspiciously dies shortly after Olaf&rsquo;s arrival, it doesn&rsquo;t take much for the children to disprove the Count&rsquo;s claim to the authorities that it was the work of Monty&rsquo;s snake, the Incredibly Deadly Viper. In the book, Sunny creates a diversion to buy her siblings time to find the necessary evidence)&mdash;with Klaus searching Monty&rsquo;s library and Violet picking the lock to Olaf&rsquo;s suitcase)&mdash;whereas in the film, Sunny merely lets the Viper play with her to prove that it&rsquo;s harmless. Compared to the book, defeating Olaf seemed too easy.</p>

            <p>Looking back, I couldn&rsquo;t have expected Silberling to retell each book in its entirety, as a film with three climaxes would&rsquo;ve grown tiresome. As Silberling mentions in the commentary track, he didn&rsquo;t want the plot to get repetitive, so he moved the final chapters of <em>The Bad Beginning</em> to the end of the film to serve as the climax while abridging the endings to the other books to serve as minor conflicts along the way. Of the three books, I feel that the ending to <em>The Bad Beginning</em> is the most effective as the height of the film. Having the children escape Olaf, only to wind up back in his hands, brings the narrative full circle. <sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup></p>

            <p>While I prefer the current Netflix show Lemony Snicket&rsquo;s <em>A Series of Unfortunate Events</em>, which better suits the episodic nature of the books, Silberling&rsquo;s work shouldn&rsquo;t be overlooked. Back in 2004, adapting the series into a movie was the only option&#58; the <em>Harry Potter</em> film adaptations were massively successful, both critically and financially, and big budget shows such as <em>Game of Thrones</em> wouldn&rsquo;t come around until a few years later. A film wasn&rsquo;t the ideal medium for these stories, which makes Silberling&rsquo;s accomplishment of weaving them into a coherent narrative all the more impressive.</p>

            <ol class="footnotes">
              <li id="fn1">The film is based off of the first three books in the series of the same name. The books covered include: <em>The Bad Beginning</em> &#40;which concerns the children with Count Olaf&#41;&#59; <em>The Reptile Room</em> &#40;the children with Uncle Monty&#41;&#59; and <em>The Wide Window</em> &#40;the children with Aunt Josephine&#41;. <a href="#ref1">&#8617;</a></li>
              <li id="fn2">Afraid of everything. <a href="#ref2">&#8617;</a></li>
              <li id="fn3">Olaf had endangered the children earlier, thus creating an opportunity for his own heroism. <a href="#ref3">&#8617;</a></li>
              <li id="fn4">I wonder if the series&rsquo; author David Handler (who goes by the pseudonym Lemony Snicket) was inspired by Silberling&rsquo;s decision, as the twelfth book, <em>The Penultimate Peril</em>, also ends with the children back in Olaf&rsquo;s clutches. <a href="#ref4">&#8617;</a></li>

            <p>Video game movies have a long history of being poorly received by critics and fans alike. Ask any gamer or movie buff for a list of good film adaptations of video games, and you&rsquo;ll maybe get one or two suggestions, if any. Enter <em>Pok&eacute;mon Detective Pikachu</em>, the adaptation of the Nintendo 3DS game of the same name. Nintendo, the video game juggernaut behind the massively successful <em>Pok&eacute;mon</em> franchise, has historically been stingy with licensing its properties for film adaptations. In fact, <em>Detective Pikachu</em> is the first live-action adaptation of a Nintendo property in over 25 years. The odds seem like they would be stacked against this movie, but thankfully, it defies the long-standing tradition of bad video game adaptations by delivering a cute little kids movie. The result is nothing spectacular, but as far as children&rsquo;s movies go, it&rsquo;s fun enough.</p>

            <p>The film takes place in the Pok&eacute;mon universe, a world inhabited by a wide variety of critters&mdash;some monstrous, some cuddly. Fans of the franchise, like myself, will delight in trying to spot all the various Pok&eacute;mon creatures in the background, but anyone else might be put off by the barrage of computer-generated imagery. The story follows Tim Goodman (Justice Smith), an insurance salesman who investigates the apparent death of his estranged father with the help of his father&rsquo;s Pok&eacute;mon partner, a Pikachu (voiced by Ryan Reynolds) clad in a Sherlock Holmes hat. Goodman and the Pikachu are magically able to communicate, even though no one else can understand the fuzzy yellow detective. The duo&rsquo;s hunt for clues takes them through Ryme City, a futuristic utopia where wild Pok&eacute;mon coexist alongside humans. Their investigation reveals that Goodman&rsquo;s father was on the trail of a case involving Mewtwo, a dangerous, powerful genetically engineered Pok&eacute;mon with psychic abilities. A series of twists and turns lead the mystery-solving duo to realize that perhaps Howard Clifford (Bill Nighy), the zillionaire philanthropist and founder of Ryme City, might be behind it all.</p>

            <p>Much of the film&rsquo;s success will depend on your familiarity with the Pok&eacute;mon franchise. The movie does not delve deep into the lore of the games or the anime series, but the film assumes the viewer has a basic knowledge of the Pok&eacute;mon universe and the creatures that inhabit it. If you are a parent or sibling who gets dragged to see this by a child, you will likely feel a little alienated. If you&rsquo;re a fan of the franchise, however, you&rsquo;ll probably find things a little easier to follow.</p>

            <p>Thankfully, <em>Detective Pikachu</em> doesn&rsquo;t indulge in callbacks or references that only older fans will catch. Fan service is tricky to get right; if handled poorly, you can wind up with something like last year&rsquo;s <em>Halloween</em> reboot, which inserted one too many winks to the fans and came across as smug. <em>Detective Pikachu</em> avoids this problem altogether by barely including references for older fans of the series. The closest thing the movie gets to being self-referential is a brief scene in which Pikachu himself sings the Pok&eacute;mon anime&rsquo;s original theme song. Otherwise, this is aimed strictly at younger fans of the series. This is not to say that older fans can&rsquo;t enjoy the film, just that they should come in with a different set of expectations.</p>

            <p><em>Detective Pikachu</em> is a straightforward kids movie of the “young person befriends a magic creature” variety. It feels strikingly similar to the 2017 kids movie <em>Monster Trucks</em> and last year&rsquo;s <em>Bumblebee</em>, which both included young adult characters who befriend cutesy CGI characters. Moreover, <em>Detective Pikachu</em> and <em>Bumblebee</em> share the oddly specific plot point of the protagonist struggling to overcome the loss of a parent as part of their character arc. This is all to say that <em>Detective Pikachu</em> is pretty generic in terms of story. It hits all the plot beats you would expect, and the mystery itself is pretty predictable.</p>

            <p>The strength of this movie lies primarily on Ryan Reynolds&rsquo;s voice performance as the titular Pok&eacute;mon character. Not only does Reynolds add a necessary bit of flair to what would otherwise be a routine kid&rsquo;s movie, he also has good chemistry with Justice Smith, who plays a perfectly serviceable (if not bland) comic foil. It also helps if you&rsquo;re easily swayed by cute things. The character animation for Pikachu is simply adorable. Although some of the other Pok&eacute;mon in the film lose their cartoony charm in the transition to photorealistic computer animation, Pikachu is certainly a memorably endearing animated character.</p>

            <p>The bar for movie adaptations of video games is unfortunately pretty low. <em>Pok&eacute;mon Detective Pikachu</em> is pretty generic, but it&rsquo;s reasonably well-constructed and well-acted. It succeeds because it plays it safe and goes for everything you&rsquo;d expect. It will still probably only appeal to fans, but even most video game adaptations can&rsquo;t achieve that honor. This movie will hardly go down as a cinematic classic, but it&rsquo;s fun in the moment and a hopeful sign that maybe we will get better video game adaptations on the big screen in the near future.</p>
